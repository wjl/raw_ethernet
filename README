Raw Ethernet C++ Library

This is a simple library that abstracts a raw ethernet socket for sending and
receiving.

For a project I needed to access a raw ethernet socket to send and receive
ethernet frames using a custom protocol at high speed. My first attempt using
libdnet and libpcap functionally worked, but it was way too slow. Doing this
with raw sockets is not hard, but getting it right, including all the necessary
error checking, is fairly tedious.

This was my solution. Since I haven't seen anything similiar in any library, I
thought I'd toss this out there for anyone else interested to use.
